## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Analysis of file hormone.csv #

This script analyzes the dataset of the hormone experiment performed on 01/01/2020. 
It contains the statistical analysis and plotting of figure 2D of the paper. 


These are the packages that we will need for the analysis
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

# Part 1
First we will have to install 
```{r}
# Import dataset with proper name handling & rename third column. 
hormone <- read.csv2("data/20201102-hormone.csv")
names(hormone)[3] <- "Concentration"
hormone
```

```{r}
# Create plot effect of drug A and B on concentration of substance X measured in blood of patients. 
ggplot(hormone, aes(Drug,Concentration)) +
  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="bar") +
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_cl_normal, geom="errorbar", width=0.25) + geom_point() +
  coord_flip()
```

There is a clear influence of the choice of drugs on the concentration of hormones present in patients blood.
